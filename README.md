# Project MySQL Vocabulary Booster

### The Assignment

Today you will do a project with the codename _Vocabulary Booster_, in which you will explore all the concepts seen so far about **SQL**.

The challenges of this project were created in order to provide means for you to practice creating more elaborate queries, often using different commands in the same query.

In this project you will use two databases: the `hr` and a new one called `w3schools`. Instructions on how to restore the bank can be read below.
